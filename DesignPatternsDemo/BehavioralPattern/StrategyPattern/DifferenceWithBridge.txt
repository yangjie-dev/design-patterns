The UML class diagram for the Strategy pattern is the same as the diagram for the Bridge pattern. 

However, these two design patterns aren't the same in their intent. 
While the Strategy pattern is meant for behavior, the Bridge pattern is meant for structure.

The coupling between the context and the strategies 
is tighter than 
the coupling between the abstraction and the implementation in the Bridge pattern.
